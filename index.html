              <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have loved technology and computers. I remember in the mid-90's our family getting our first computer, a 486. I spent as much time on that thing as I possibly could. When the internet finally became more widely available, I started making very basic web pages on Geocities, Angel Fire, and Tripod. Since then I have made some web pages for my previous law firm and current company utilizing WordPress.</p>
